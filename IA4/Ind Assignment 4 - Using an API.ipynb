    "# Individual Assignment 4 - Using an API\n",
    "In this assignment, students will explore public Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) learn how to make a connection to a public API to query for data and use the data that is returned.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "The goal of this lesson is to help students learn how to connect to public APIs and as a function of researching these APIs get an understanding of the common patterns and practices of setting up an API end point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "1. A PDF of a completed notebook OR a link to the repository where the final version of the notebook is store.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "As a data analyst, data is the fuel that drives the engine of discovery.  Often times this means using data we have collected with web forms, using external systems or via some business process.  Occassionally, we'll be given the data directly or we can download some data from a webpage that meets our needs.  Being able to gather data from sources on the web is a skill that is often very useful.  Wouldn't it be great if you could download [weather data predictions](https://www.abstractapi.com/api/weather#:~:text=What%20does%20the%20Weather%20API%20do%3F%20Abstract%27s%20Weather,and%20forecasted%20weather%20data%20for%20millions%20of%20locations.) as part of your morning routine, or grab [movies reviews](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) to make plans for the weekend or even get data from the [James Webb Telescope](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/webb/about/index.html) so you can process your own images from outer space!\n",
    "\n",
    "Web APIs are a powerful tool for developers to access data and functionality from other applications. They allow developers to query data from a remote server and receive a response in a structured format, such as JSON or XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are literally millions of web APIs available on the internet, some are private and only available to known and trusted business partners, many are available at a cost to the consumer and others are free.  Some have utilization caps for free use and expose more utilization and premium features to paying customers.  Here are just a very few commonly used, public APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common third-party APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs), which allows you to do things like displaying your latest tweets on your website.\n",
    "- Map APIs, like [Mapquest](https://developer.mapquest.com/) and the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/), which allow you to do all sorts of things with maps on your web pages.\n",
    "- The [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/) suite of APIs, which enables you to use various parts of the Facebook ecosystem to benefit your app, such as by providing app login using Facebook login, accepting in-app payments, rolling out targeted ad campaigns, etc.\n",
    "- The [Telegram APIs](https://core.telegram.org/api), which allows you to embed content from Telegram channels on your website, in addition to providing support for bots.\n",
    "- The [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/), which allows you to embed YouTube videos on your site, search YouTube, build playlists, and more.\n",
    "- The [Pinterest API](https://developers.pinterest.com/), which provides tools to manage Pinterest boards and pins to include them in your website.\n",
    "- The [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/), which provides a framework for building voice and video call functionality into your app, sending SMS/MMS from your apps, and more.\n",

    "# Part 2 - Using a public API\n",
    "It's not easy to find public APIs that don't require some kind of credentials.  The reason for is that when you provide credentials (usually an API \"key\"), the developer of the API can limit the number of requests your program makes and can determine which API calls are being used by a particular end-point.  There is cost to running an API, the cost of the compute resources, disk space and network traffic - all which can add up, so charging a little bit of money can help defray these costs and ensure that the endpoints requesting data are serious enough to spend a little money to make their application go.\n",
    "\n",
    "While every API interaction is different (most APIs have documentation showing examples of how to call it), there are some basic principals/tools/patterns we can employ.

    "\n",
    "There are several different request types that can be sent to a webpage (GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, et al). GET is used to navigate a static website, sometimes using query parameters as we have seen already.  PUT and POST are used to submit data on a form.  We'll leave the others for a more advanced treatise.  For our purposes, we'll just take a look at GET.  \n",

Once you have got it working, then replace the fixed zip code with your user request.  This will save you from having to type in the zip code everytime you run the app while you are developing it\n",

The best idea is to break it down one step at a time, like we did above until you get to the exact item you are looking for before trying to put it all into a single line of Python code\n",
